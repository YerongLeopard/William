|  ADVICE TO THIS USER RUNNING 'VASP/VAMP'   (HEAR YOUR MASTER'S VOICE ...):  |
|                                                                             |
|      You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells       |
|      it might be more efficient to use real space projection operators      |
|      So try LREAL= Auto  in the INCAR   file.                               |
|      Mind: If you want to do a very accurate calculations keep the          |
|      reciprocal projection scheme          (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.)             |
|                                                                             |
